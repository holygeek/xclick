USAGE

	xclick

DESCRIPTION

	xclick - trigger mouse click in X whenever the mouse stopped moving.

	When  run  without  any  argument, xclick monitors your mouse movement.
	When the mouse stops moving it triggers a left mouse click.

HOW IT WORKS

	xclick triggers the click event when the following conditions are met:

	    1. The mouse stopped moving for more than 300ms.
	    2. The distance moved from the last stop is more than 10 pixels.


CAVEAT

	xclick depends on the xdotool program to do the actual clicking because
	I'm too lazy to do it the proper way at the moment. You can get xdotool here:
